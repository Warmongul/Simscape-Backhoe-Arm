Backhoe Arm with Hydraulic Actuation
Copyright 2013-2019 The MathWorks, Inc.

Models a backhoe arm with three hydraulic actuators connected via a
hydraulic network.  A control system tracks reference angles for
the boom, arm, and bucket. Hyperlinks on the top level of the model
create key plots and open the demo script which leads to other models.

Run >>startup_Backhoe to get started.

The model opened at startup was created using native Simscape Multibody
geometry.  Another version that uses a CAD model imported from Onshape(R)
is also included.
